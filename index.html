      <h1>The art of T-Spins</h1>
      <p>
        Learning to T-Spin in tetris will expand your playstyle and mind.
        The beginner's strategy for sending many lines or getting a high score
        would be to create a large stack of lines and then clearing four rows using
        the 'l' piece. This manuever is called the <strong>Tetris Line Clear</strong>
        (otherwise known as a <em>Tetris</em>).
        This strategy is efficient but because of it's easy learning curve,
        the rewards reaped are low as well. If you plan on doubling your number of lines
        sent or tripling high score, you'll need to learn a new strategy.
        Introducing the <strong>T-Spin</strong>!
      </p>
      <h2>What is a T-Spin?</h2>
      <p>
        A T-Spin is the manuever in which the 'T' piece is spun after it has fallen in place.
        The spin causes one of the piece's sides to fit into a position otherwise
        unreachable. This manuever sends the same amount of lines as a Tetris but it's set up
        time is much faster.

      <h2>Why should I use it?</h2>
      <p>
        Applying the T-Spin set up to your Tetris games is a way to change up your playstyle.
        It requires more fast-paced planning than the Tetris Strategy. Also, the T-Spin works
        together with the <em>Tetris Piece Algorithm</em>; every game may be a perfect T-spin game
        as long as you do not mess up. Even upon messing up the structure, improvising to fix the set-up
        is another fun aspect of the T-Spin strategy.

      <h2>How to T-Spin</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3>Step 1: Setting up a T-Spin</h3>
          <p>
            To set up a T-Spin, there needs to be an opening that only a T-piece may enter
            and rotate into. Generally, it is good practice to have an openning on the right
            of the T-Spin entry instead of the left as it only takes one spin to fit the 'T' piece.
          </p>
        </li>

          <h3>Step 2: Clearing lines with T-Spins</h3>
          <p>
            To clear lines with the T-spin, make sure that the row is completely filled
            except for the T-spin openning. This will ensure that the 'T' piece is the piece
            that completes the row and clears the line. It is very rewarding to perform a
            T-Spin and will make you look like a Tetris Professional!
